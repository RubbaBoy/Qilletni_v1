## Qilletni
Generate infinite, dynamic, and intelligent Spotify queues.

Qilletni is a multi-platform application to allow for drag-and-drop block-based organizing of components to sequentially generate Spotify queues as you listen. The component based system is best compared to [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Once you create a queue generator, upon starting it through the app, a few songs are added to your linked Spotify account's queue. As you play the queued songs, more are added, all according to the rules you set in the components.

This project stemmed from Adam's obsession of queuing up a large selection of songs, in a way that could be structured. This includes patterns like queuing up the same few songs over and over again, and wanting to continue playing from a playlist. This also introduces concepts like weighted playlists, which can play songs more frequently in playlists or existing queues.

Available components include:
- Function blocks
- For loop (with iteration options) to iterate through nested components
- Single preset song player
- Spotify collection playing (including playlist, artist, album and on-the-fly searching)
- Last.fm playing (including top tracks, top artists, top albums, and loved tracks)
